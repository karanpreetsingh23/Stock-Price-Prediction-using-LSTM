# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
The repo has been created for a basic stock price predictor model designed using LSTM. 
The model was created as a project for the course ELEC 825 - Machine Learning and Deep Learning offered in Fall 2021 at Queen's University.
<br /><br />
Multiple python notebooks with appropriate titles have been uploaded. These notebooks show not only the final code but also various hyperparameter tuning that has been carried out. <br /><br />
Specifically, following hyperparameters have been tuned:
<br />
a) Testing the model with or without dropout layers. <br />
b) Varying the number of layers <br />
c) Varying the number of epochs <br />
c) Varying the size of dataset <br />
d) Varying Batch Size
